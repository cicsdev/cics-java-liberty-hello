    <!-- The following configuration controls how often server.xml
         is scanned for updates. The default is every 500ms which may
         cause excessive I/O and CPU cost on z/OS.
         The values shown below reduce the overhead while still
         providing a relatively timely detection of new applications
         that have been installed/removed via a CICS Bundle
         (WAR bundlepart). If you use CICS bundles to install Web
         Applications (WAR files) do not use the "disabled"
         updateTrigger.
    -->
    <config monitorInterval="5s" updateTrigger="polled" />

    <!-- Further scanning is performed to detect application updates or
         addition/removal of applications to the dropins directory. If
         you are using CICS Bundles as the vehicle for Application
         deployment you should disable the dropins directory as shown.
         Further I/O and CPU reduction can be achieved by disabling
         the application scan. To effect changes to your applications
         while the server is still running, you should disable and
         re-enable the CICS bundle that contains the Web application.
         The pollingRate is only applicable when the updateTrigger is
         set to the 'polled' value.
         Consult the WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile
         documentation for further information on these parameters.

    <!-- By default, the cdi-1.2 feature scans all application archives.
         The cdi-1.2 feature can increase startup time substantially
         and have the most effect on larger applications. Implicit
         archive scanning for annotations can be disabled by setting
         enableImplicitBeanArchives value to false. This setting skips
         the scanning of archives unless they contain a beans.xml.
         Even if not explicitly coded, the cdi-1.2 feature might be
         enabled through other features, such as the javaee-7.0
         convenience feature.
